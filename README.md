## Planning

### String Calculator

making math papers easer to read, scanning the string for sums
extracting the sums as strings
evaluates the sum
outputs the sum string with reslut.

just 2 terms

evaluate("1 + 1")

Input : "1 + 1"
output : ["1 + 1", 2]

handles
- addition
- subtraction
- mutliplcation
- division
- BIDMAS (not a priority)

edge case
- the result will be an int
- will always be an int
- shouldnt be any characters in the sring, if there is rase a math error. "Input must be a vaild mathimatical string seperated by spaces"
- just a number will not raise errors
